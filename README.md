# Melexis Compact Master LIN (MCM-LIN) PCB

This project assembles the Melexis Compact Master LIN (MCM-LIN) PCB which can be used to bootload and
control the [Melexis](https://www.melexis.com) products via [Local Interconnected Network (LIN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interconnect_Network) protocol.

The MCM-LIN is a hardware platform which is built upon the [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/) ESP32 and provides
an easy to use evaluation setup for the Melexis LIN products.
